Samples of web applications implemented in Kotlin.

`hello-javalin` is a very basic 'Hello World' application, written using the
[Javalin](https://javalin.io/) framework.

`hello-http4k` is the equivalent of `hello-javalin`, but implemented using
[http4k](https://http4k.org/).

`hello-ktor` is the equivalent of `hello-javalin`, but implemented using
[Ktor](https://ktor.io/).

`music-club` is a more fully-featured, database-backed Javalin application,
using the [Exposed](https://jetbrains.github.io/Exposed/) framework to
handle database queries.

`music-club-ktor` is `music-club` with Ktor used in place of Javalin.
