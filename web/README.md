# web

Samples of web applications implemented in Kotlin.

`javalin-hello` is a very basic 'Hello World' application, written using the
[Javalin](https://javalin.io/) framework.

`music-club` is a more fully-featured, database-backed Javalin application,
using the [Exposed](https://jetbrains.github.io/Exposed/) framework to
handle database queries.
