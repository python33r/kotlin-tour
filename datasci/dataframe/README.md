# dataframe

A Kotlin application that uses the [DataFrames][kdf] library to analyze
the Titanic passengers dataset.

The dataset itself is in `data/titanic.csv`.

You can open this directory in IntelliJ and run `Main.kt` directly or
choose the `run` task from the Gradle tool window.

Alternatively, to run the application from the command line, do

    ./gradlew run
