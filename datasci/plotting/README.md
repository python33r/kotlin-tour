# plotting

A Kotlin application to plot weather station data.

The dataset can be found in `data/leeds_2019.csv`. It consists of
measurements made at a weather station in Leeds during 2019.

The application generates two plots, exporting one as an SVG file and
the other as a PNG image. Both are stored in the `lets-plot-images`
directory.

To run from the command line, do

    ./gradlew run
