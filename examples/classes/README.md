# classes

Examples of defining and using classes in Kotlin.

`Account.java` contains the definition of a basic entity class in Java,
for representing bank accounts, plus a small test program.

`Account.kt` is the Kotlin equivalent of `Account.java`. Notice how close
to 50 lines of Java class definition condense to *a single line of Kotlin*.

(To be fair, Java has the `Record`, with which a simple entity class can
also be defined with a single line of code - but this works only for cases
where all fields of the class are immutable.)
