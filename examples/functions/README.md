# functions

Examples of defining and using functions in Kotlin.

`simple.kts` shows some functions simple enough to have expression bodies.

`triangle.kt` is a Kotlin program that computes the area of a triangle using
Heron's formula. Lengths of triangle sides are input by the user. Separate
functions are defined to read the length of a side and compute the area.
Both functions have block bodies.

`longest.kt` contains another example of a function with a block body. This
program find the longest word in a text file whose name is supplied on the
command line.

`vararg.kts` demonstrates the use of `vararg` in function parameter lists.

`lambda.kts` demonstrates various practical uses of lambda functions.

`with.kts` shows how the `with` scope function can be used.
