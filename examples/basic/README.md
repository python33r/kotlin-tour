Some examples of basic Kotlin syntax.

`hello.kt` is the canonical first program in Kotlin. Compare this with
`Hello.java`, which has more 'scaffolding'. In Kotlin you are not required
to put code written in a procedural style within classes. (Classes will
still be created by the compiler, since this is what the JVM requires, but
you don't need to worry about that little detail!)

`hello2.kt` expands the 'Hello World' example, demonstating use of command
line arguments, if expressions and string interpolation.

`varval.kts` is some KotlinScript demonstrating the difference between
`var` and `val`. You should also take a look at `mutable.kts`, which shows
that declaring something as `val` doesn't necessarily make it constant.

`strings1.kts` and `strings2.kts` provide various examples of Kotlin string
handling (properties, indexing, slicing, iteration, invoking methods).
