# basic

Some examples of basic Kotlin syntax.

`hello.kt` is the canonical first program in Kotlin. Compare this with
`Hello.java`, which has more 'scaffolding'. In Kotlin you are not required
to put code written in a procedural style within classes. (Classes will
still be created by the compiler, since this is what the JVM requires, but
you don't need to worry about that little detail!)

`hello2.kt` expands the 'Hello World' example, demonstating use of command
line arguments, if expressions and string interpolation.
