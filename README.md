# kotlin-tour

Slides and code examples for 'Tour of Kotlin' presentation.

The presentation itself uses only a few of these code examples; the rest are
provided for session attendees to study in their own time so that they can
develop a feel for what Kotlin is like.

Most of the examples are quite small, but the `comparison` directory contains
two implementations of a complete application, one in Java, the other in
Kotlin, allowing for a direct comparison of the two languages.

**Neither the slides nor the code examples are intended to provide exhaustive
coverage of the language. A _lot_ has been deliberately left out.**
