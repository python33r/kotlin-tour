# kotlin-tour

Slides and code examples for 'Tour of Kotlin' presentation.

The presentation is intended to last no more than 2 hours.

Some of the code examples are used in the presentation but most are provided
for session attendees to study in their own time so that they can develop
a feel for what Kotlin is like.

**Neither the slides nor the code examples are intended to provide exhaustive
coverage of the language. A _lot_ has been deliberately left out.**
