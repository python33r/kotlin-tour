# kotlin-tour

Slides and code examples for proposed 'Tour of Kotlin' presentation.

The slides are for a session that lasts no more than 2 hours, with a break
in the middle.

The code examples are for session attendees to study in their own time
so that they can develop a feel for what Kotlin is like.

Neither the slides not the code examples are intended to provide exhaustive
coverage of the language. A _lot_ has been deliberately left out.
